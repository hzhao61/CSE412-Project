# CSE412_Apartments
Command Line Tempe Apartment Finding Application

# Options

So, I wasnt sure how we wanted the user to interact with the command line so I did a couple of things.  

First, you can see how to do a really simple query in showAll on line 38.  

A more complicated query is in customQuery on line 50.

Basically, the user can either choose a structured filter option or they can do a quick query by apartment, bedroom count, and cost (option 4)

# Notes

There are bugs in the logic but I'm not going to fix them rn since I'm not sure if you guys even want the menu option
